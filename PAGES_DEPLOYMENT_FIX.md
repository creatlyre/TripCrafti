# Quick Fix for Pages Deployment

## Problem
Cloudflare Pages doesn't support Durable Objects in the same way as regular Workers. The current configuration causes deployment errors.

## Solution 

### Option 1: Deploy without Durable Objects (Recommended for now)

The current `wrangler.toml` has been configured to deploy Pages without Durable Objects. The application will fail gracefully when trying to use Durable Objects and return a proper error message.

```bash
# This should now work
npx wrangler pages deploy
```

### Option 2: Two-step deployment with separate Worker (Future enhancement)

If you want to use Durable Objects with Pages in the future:

1. **Deploy the Durable Object as a separate Worker:**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler-worker.toml
   ```

2. **Update wrangler.toml to reference the Worker:**
   ```toml
   [[durable_objects.bindings]]
   name = "ITINERARY_GENERATOR"
   class_name = "ItineraryDurableObject"
   script_name = "tripcrafti-durable-objects"
   ```

3. **Deploy Pages:**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler pages deploy
   ```

## Current Behavior

- The application will attempt to use Durable Objects
- If they're not available, it will:
  - Log the error
  - Mark the itinerary as FAILED in the database
  - Return a clear error message to the user
- Users won't get stuck in a "generating" state

This provides a better user experience than the previous timeout issues.
